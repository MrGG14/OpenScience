First of all you need to install Gobrid from Docker as specified in [GobridÂ´s containers documentation](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Grobid-docker/). CRF-only image is recomended.

To install initialize the docker daemon and execute: 
```
docker pull lfoppiano/grobid:0.8.0
```

Then you should clone this repository locally.
