Repository for Artificial Intelligence And Open Science. The aim of this repository is to create a Gobrid client which will perform an analysis over 30
open-access articles and:

- Extract metadata such as abstract, authors, publication date, referenced authors and organizactions.
  
- Compare papers assigning a similitude metric between them.
  
- Topic modelling using LDA.

-  Make local Knlowledge Graph in RDF.

-  Expanding our Knowledge Graph with external information.
