<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The integration of deep learning systems into healthcare has been hindered by the resource-intensive process of data annotation and the inability of these systems to generalize to different data distributions. Foundation models, which are models pre-trained on large datasets, have emerged as a solution to reduce reliance on annotated data and enhance model generalizability and robustness. DINOv2 is an open-source foundation model pre-trained with self-supervised learning on 142 million curated natural images that exhibits promising capabilities across various vision tasks. Nevertheless, a critical question remains unanswered regarding DINOv2's adaptability to radiological imaging, and whether its features are sufficiently general to benefit radiology image analysis. Therefore, this study comprehensively evaluates DINOv2 for radiology, conducting over 100 experiments across diverse modalities (X-ray, CT, and MRI). To measure the effectiveness and generalizability of DINOv2's feature representations, we analyze the model across medical image analysis tasks including disease classification and organ segmentation on both 2D and 3D images, and under different settings like kNN, few-shot learning, linear-probing, end-to-end fine-</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Radiology imaging plays a pivotal role in modern medicine, serving as an indispensable tool for accurate and timely diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The importance of radiological imaging lies in its ability to provide detailed and non-invasive visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> of the internal structures and functions of the human body. Deep learning-based computer vision methods have been successful at analyzing and processing radiological imaging, leading to systems that can extract clinically-relevant information with high accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, the success of these systems has been reliant on annotated medical data, which is expensive to obtain because it requires the time and effort of trained radiologists <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Moreover, these systems can achieve high-level accuracy only within a specified scope, but fail to generalize across domains, tasks, and slight data distribution shifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Recently, the field of computer vision has seen a rise in interest for general-purpose models that are optimized to function across different tasks and domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. These models, grouped under the term "Foundation Models" (FMs), usually contain parameters ranging from hundreds of millions to tens of billions and are trained on large datasets, on the order of tens of millions.</p><p>As a result of this large-scale training, these FMs often achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and impressive zero-shot and few-shot performance and generalizability <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. For these reasons, foundation models have gained traction in deep learning-based medical image analysis research <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, as they hold promise for reducing the reliance on the expensive process of annotating medical data and towards the goal of building generalist medical artificial intelligence systems that can function across a variety of tasks and domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">What Are Foundation Models?</head><p>The term foundation model is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of seemingly different models. In the most general sense, foundation models are large models trained on large datasets and can generalize across tasks and/or domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. To make the term more useful in our analysis, however, we group FMs using two methods of categorization. First, we divide FMs depending on their training paradigm into three groups: self-supervised, weakly-supervised, and supervised foundation models. Weakly-supervised and supervised foundation models require correspondence in the training data. In these paradigms, the training data is required to be available in pairs: an X-ray examination and a corresponding interpretation, diagnosis, or segmentation mask for example. Models like OpenAI's CLIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> fall under this category. Self-supervised foundation models, on the other hand, require one input data to train (an image, text, audio, etc.) Meta's DINOv2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and Google's Universal Speech Model (USM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> belong to this category.</p><p>Additionally, we categorize FMs into two groups depending on the generalizability of their produced representations: general purpose (also called task-agnostic), and task-specific FMs. General purpose foundation models produce features that generalize across more than one task, segmentation and classification for example, while task-specific models specialize on only one task. DINOv2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and USM <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> fall under the former category while SAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> is under the latter.</p><p>Because of the less restrictive training dependencies for self-supervised FMs, we believe that they are a promising option to explore for future research especially for the medical imaging domain, since public medical image data are abundant but often without corresponding descriptions or diagnoses, either due to patient privacy barriers, data collection overhead, or other issues. Moreover, FMs that produce representations that can be used across a variety of tasks are desired because it is usually a signal of model robustness. As a result, we focus our attention on self-supervised general-purpose FMs for medical image analysis. Specifically, we adopt Meta's DINOv2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> model, a publicly available general-purpose vision foundation model that can extract robust representations across different vision tasks, for experimentation on a wide range of medical disease classification and organ segmentation benchmarks, across different radiological exams and under different evaluation settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">What is DINOv2?</head><p>DINOv2 is a successor of DINO <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and constitutes both a self-supervised pre-training method based on DINO and iBOT <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and a collection of models pre-trained using that method. It was released to the public by Meta in April 2023 and promises robust representations that enable general-purpose functionality with visual-only data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The released models were pre-trained on a dataset of 142 million carefully curated natural images, called LVD-142M. Roughly 100 million of these are images that are similar to ImageNet, curated from calculating similarly of web-scarpered images with ImageNet21k dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. The remaining images were retrieved based on their similarity to Caltech 101 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, ADE20k <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and Google Landmarks v2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, among others.</p><p>The models achieve competitive performance on classification, segmentation, depth estimation, and image retrieval tasks across both image and video benchmarks. Moreover, because of the adopted discriminative self-distillation approach, DINOv2 performs well "out-of-the-box," without the need to fine-tune the encoder. The ViT-g/14 version of the model achieves an accuracy of 86.5% and 83.5% on Linear-probing and kNN evaluations, respectively, on ImageNet-1k, outperforming other weakly-supervised and self-supervised methods. This capability to perform well out-of-the-box is appealing, especially in the medical domain, as it implies competitive performance even in low-data and low-computation settings. Thresholding is used on the first component to remove the background.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Contribution</head><p>In this paper, we set to work towards vision-only general-purpose foundation models for the medical domain by adopting DINOv2 for disease classification and organ segmentation benchmarks.</p><p>We perform comprehensive evaluations of DINOv2 across various scenarios for multiple radiology modalities, exploring both low (few-shot) and high data settings spanning X-ray, CT, and MRI examinations.</p><p>We evaluate DINOv2 on both disease classification and organ segmentation benchmarks. For disease classification tasks, we evaluate the model on kNN, linear-probing, few-shot learning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and end-to-end fine-tuning scenarios. For organ segmentation tasks we compare lightweight and non-lightweight decoders, while we keep the DINOv2 backbone frozen.</p><p>We compared the results to supervised, weakly-supervised, and self-supervised models. As far as we know, there is no comprehensive analysis of DINOv2 on medical benchmarks that evaluates the model across disease classification and organ segmentation tasks and on different radiological examinations. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• Evaluate DINOv2 on disease classification and organ segmentation radiology benchmarks, under different evaluation settings. We conclude that DINOv2 outperforms self-supervised and weakly-supervised models on classification tasks and is competitive with supervised models pre-trained on ImageNet21K. For segmentation tasks, we observe that DINOv2 outperforms weakly-supervised methods by a large margin, and outperforms or is competitive with supervised methods trained end-to-end.</p><p>• Analyze the cross-task generalizability of DINOv2 compared to supervised, self-supervised, and weakly-supervised models. Our analysis concludes that weakly-supervised models perform well on classification tasks only, and masked imaged modeling self-supervision performs well only on segmentation tasks, while DINOv2 can generalize across both tasks. DINOv2 also outperforms supervised classification models when evaluated on segmentation tasks, and outperforms SAM for disease classification.</p><p>• Employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning with a DINOv2 ViT-g/14 model on large X-ray classification datasets and provide a performance and efficiency comparison of PEFT with end-toend fine-tuning and linear-probing. We conclude that using PEFT can yield performance that is competitive with end-to-end fine-tuning using less than 1% of the total model parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Works</head><p>Supervised foundation models. Training a large-scale network with supervised learning is non-trivial because it is difficult to combine different labels together. This is even more true in the medical domain where labeled data is scarce. Even still when labels are seemingly similar, other issues can arise. Cohen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> have attempted to train a large-scale X-ray foundation model with supervised learning by combining public chest X-ray disease classification datasets that share diseases. their analysis highlights the fact that discrepancies in labeling caused by disease concept shift across hospitals and observers can lead to worse generalizations for deep learning models.</p><p>Regardless, there successful attempts at building a large-scale supervised foundation model. The Segemnt Anything Model (SAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, a supervised foundation model for prompt-based segmentation trained with automatically extracted segmentation masks, is one of those attempts. Since the release of SAM, its applicability for the medical images has been explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref>]. It's performance for medical segmentation was found to be inadequate in most cases and highly variable.</p><p>Because of that, Ma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> have developed MedSAM by adopting SAM for the medical domain using a dataset of more than one million medical images across diverse segmentation tasks and examination modalities. MedSAM significantly outperforms SAM on medical tasks and achieves comparable performance to U-Net <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> models. Still, MedSAM is limited to medical segmentation, and it is unclear whether it can be generalized to other medical image analysis tasks.</p><p>Weakly-supervised foundation models. Previous research has explored weakly-supervised vision-language models for zero-shot classification, visual question answering, and image generation in the medical domain, achieving SoTA or competitive performance on radiology benchmarks <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> applied contrastive learning to paired X-ray image-report for learning visual representations. However, the availability of corresponding image-text pairs is a stringent requirement to be applicable for most medical datasets. Moreover, as highlighted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, a false negative issue exists when applying this learning paradigm in the medical domain because, unlike diverse natural images, medical reports can describe other patients that are not necessarily paired. Instead, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> proposed MedCLIP, employing an extension of CLIP's contrastive pre-training method that utilizes unpaired examination-report samples, using the MIMIC-CXR <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and CheXpert <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> datasets. They outperform previous SoTA on zero-shot and supervised classification on four radiology benchmarks. Yet, the performance of MedCLIP, along with other vision-language models, is still limited by the availability of text-image data.</p><p>Self-supervised foundation models. Self-supervised pre-training applied to medical datasets has recently achieved SoTA on CT and MRI segmentation benchmarks <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Tang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> pre-trained a Swin UNETR <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> architecture with self-supervision on 5,050 CT volumes and outperformed previous SoTA on the BTCV <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and MSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> competitions. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no self-supervised general-purpose FM for the medical domain that has achieved consistently competitive results across tasks and radiological examinations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Methodology</head><p>In this section, we describe the motivation for adopting DINOv2 for this study and outline the settings under which we performed our experiments. We do not detail the pre-processing and hyperparameter tuning pipeline and instead publicly release our code (available in Section 6), in which these details can be found.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Motivation for Using DINOv2</head><p>There are many vision foundation models trained with supervised, self-supervised, and weaklysupervised learning on natural images <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. However, we decided to employ DINOv2 in our analysis because of the robustness of its representations, achieving competitive performance in multiple downstream tasks, across vision modalities (image and video), and, most importantly, in out-of-the-box evaluations. The DINOv2 training paradigm was specifically designed to generate powerful representations on out-of-the-box kNN evaluations and outperforms many other weaklysupervised and self-supervised foundation models in kNN and linear-probing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Datasets</head><p>We evaluated DINOv2 on 9 public radiology benchmarks, spanning X-ray, CT, and MRI examinations (Exam.) for disease classification (CLS, 4 datasets) and organ segmentation (SEG, 5 datasets) tasks. A summary of the used datasets is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. "# Classes" describes the number of classes and "# Images/Volumes" describes the number of images for 2D datasets and volumes for 3D datasets, and not the number in the original dataset. For some of the datasets shown, we only selected a sample of the entire available data. Moreover, some of the datasets used do not have a predefined test set. On these datasets, we used systemic sampling to divide the dataset into train, evaluation, and test subsets. All the datasets used are publicly available, and we provide a link for downloading our specific train, validation, and test split in Section 6.</p><p>Moreover, The data pre-processing pipeline is also available in the GitHub repository in Section 6.</p><p>The datasets were chosen based on the diversity of tasks and modalities and not on their clinical usefulness or value. Classifying different brain tumors types might not be a clinically applicable task, but we still included it in our analysis to gauge how each model performs in disease classification with MRI examinations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Evaluation Settings</head><p>In our analysis, we focused mainly on the "out-of-the-box" performance of DINOv2, where we trained classification or segmentation heads while keeping the backbone frozen. This resulted in preferable lightweight training that requires fewer labeled instances, computational resources, and training time. Additionally, we also performed end-to-end fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning evaluations for performance comparison to this lightweight training paradigm.</p><p>We experimented with the original DINOv2 ViT-g/14 and the three smaller distilled versions (ViT-L/14, ViT-B/14, and ViT-S/14). We compared the performance and generalizability of DINOv2 to supervised, self-supervised, and weakly-supervised models. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> detailed all the models used. A critical part of our work is that we standardized the training and hyperparameter tuning pipeline ViT-g/14 LVD-142M CLS, SEG 142M 1,100M <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for each model and evaluation task, with the goal of isolating model performance. In this way, we can gain a clearer understanding of which models perform best under the same evaluation settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1.">Disease Classification</head><p>We performed four main types of experiments: kNN, linear-probing, few-shot learning, and finetuning. (1) kNN was performed on the normalized features of the last backbone layer. (2) For linear-probing, a single linear layer was attached on top of the backbone. (3) In few-shot learning, we trained a linear layer on top of frozen features. (4) For fine-tuning, we used both parameterefficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and BitFit <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> and end-to-end fine-tuning.</p><p>When performing linear-probing with ViT architectures, the linear layer takes either the CLS token or the CLS token concatenated with the average of all patch tokens, depending on which method yielded higher performance in the validation set. In multi-labeled classification, we predicted each class as a binary and averaged the model's result across all classes, and we used the method described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> for kNN. For 3D volumes, the embeddings for all slices were averaged before being passed into the classification head.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Organ Segmentation</head><p>For organ segmentation evaluations, we kept the encoder frozen and attached a U-Net, hierarchical decoder on top. The U-Net decoder is made up of four blocks, where each block consists of one convolutional layer along with ReLU activation function and batch normalization. Skip connections were obtained from the previous four blocks of the transformer model and concatenated to the features at each U-Net layer, as is done in the classical U-Net architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>We also compared the performance of DINOv2 to segmentation architectures that are commonly used in medical image analysis including U-Net and TransUnet, trained end-to-end in a supervised fashion, and experimented with using a lightweight single linear layer decoder as a comparison with the U-Net decoder. For processing 3D volumes, we segmented each slice independently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head><p>In this section, we report our results across the different evaluation settings, tasks, and radiological modalities. We compare the performance of DINOv2 to weakly-supervised models including CLIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and OpenCLIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, and self-supervised models including MAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> and MSN <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, and supervised models. We used the area under the operating receiver curve (AUROC) as a performance metric for classification tasks, and the average of the dice and jaccard scores as a metric for segmentation. We report only the best checkpoint across the epochs tested for each model.</p><p>In Section 4.1 and we will evaluate DINOv2 on disease classification and organ segmentation tasks.</p><p>For segmentation, we will also show a comparison between using a linear layer decoder and a U-Net, hierarchical decoder on top of the frozen DINOv2 ViT-L/14 features. Then, in Section 4.3, we will explore the few-shot learning capability of DINOv2 on both disease classification and organ segmentation tasks. After that, in Section 4.4, we perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning to compare the performance and efficiency of using PEFT with end-to-end fine-tuning and linear </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Disease Classification and Organ Segmentation</head><p>We will start by analyzing the performance of DINOv2 ViT-g/14 and ViT-L/14 on linear-probing.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the AUROC scores of both DINOv2 models compared to weakly-supervised and self-supervised models on four disease classification benchmarks. DINOv2 outperforms all other models on the more difficult large X-ray datasets and achieves performance closer to weaklysupervised models that are trained on much larger datasets. The ViT-L version of the model seemingly underperforms on 3D CT classification but is competitive with the ViT-g/14 version on all other classification tasks. Additionally Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the linear-probing performance of all DINOv2 models compared to supervised learning methods on X-ray, CT, and MRI disease classification datasets. DINOv2 performs on par or slightly better compared to supervised methods, and outperforms by a relatively larger margin commonly-used CNN supervised models.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the kNN, linear-probing, and end-to-end fine-tuning results of DINOv2 compared to other supervised, weakly-supervised, and self-supervised methods on the NIH Chest X-ray and CheXpert datasets. Just like in linear probing, DINOv2 outperforms self-supervised methods in end-to-end fine-tuning but is competitive with weakly-supervised and supervised methods. Also important to highlight that DINOv2 under-performs on kNN evaluations compared to other methods, even though its features were designed to maximize kNN results. This might be explained by the domain shift between natural images in the pre-training and medical images, making the out-of-the-box kNN evaluations more random.</p><p>Moreover, we provide a comparison for segmentation tasks in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. When comparing just image sizes of 224x224, DINOv2 performs the second-best, just behind MAE, which outperforms DINOv2 on all but one segmentation task. This can be explained given MAE's inherently spatial learning objective. An important point to note here is that all models except DINOv2 were pre-trained on image sizes of 224x224. At the end of the DINOv2 pre-training, it was adapted to image size 518x518, leading to worse performance on smaller image sizes due to positional encoding interpolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Even then, DINOv2 still outperforms weakly-supervised models and MSN pre-training. When using image sizes closer to DINOv2's pre-training, it outperforms all other methods. However, it is difficult to determine how much of this increased performance is due to reduced interpolation of positional encoding or to higher details resulting from the larger DINOv2 compared to segmentation architectures. In Table <ref type="table">6</ref> we compare U-Net decoders on top of frozen DINOv2 ViT-L/14 and ViT-g/14 features with U-Net and TransUnet models trained end-to-end from scratch. The results of all models are similar on the easier MC dataset, but DINOv2 outperforms the other U-Net and TransUnet on the more difficult AMOS multi-organ segmentation task even with a frozen encoder and less trainable parameters. On the MSD datasets, DINOv2 is competitive but there is variability in the performance.</p><p>U-Net vs linear decoders. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows a performance comparison between using a linear layer decoder and a U-Net decoder on top of frozen DINOv2 ViT-L/14 features on the organ segmentation datasets. The linear layer decoder evaluations are used to isolate the performance of the DINOv2 encoder, analogous to the purpose of kNN classification evaluations. On the MC dataset where the target mask is large, linear and U-Net performance is comparable, highlighting the strong out-of-the-box features of DINOv2. The gap in performance increases, however, on MSD datasets where target masks are usually much smaller, making them harder to predict with a single layer. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows qualitative segmentation for both methods.  At the top row of Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, we start by comparing DINOv2 ViT-L/14 to weakly-supervised and self-supervised methods. The top-left subplot shows the performance on the NIH Chest X-ray disease classification dataset, while the top-right subplot shows the performance on the MC lung segmentation datasets. For disease classification, there is no clear trend when the number of patients used for each class is between 1 and 4, but when 8 patients are used, DINOv2 outperforms all other methods. For organ segmentation, DINOv2 outperforms all other methods from the start and is only worse than MAE when the entire dataset is used.</p><p>A similar trend can be observed at the bottom row of Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, where we compare DINOv2 with supervised methods. The bottom-left subplot shows that DINOv2 outperforms other methods when the number of patients are 8 or more, but to a lesser degree compared to self-supervised and weakly-supervised methods. For organ segmentation, DINOv2 outperforms other models by a large margin when using less than eight instances, which is somewhat expected given it was pre-trained while the other segmentation models were not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning</head><p>We experiment with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques on DINOv2 ViT-g/14, which, as a whole, contains 1.1 billion parameters. PEFT methods are used to enable efficient adaptation of large models to downstream tasks, usually achieving performance that is on par with end-to-end fine-tuning while requiring a lot less compute and memory. Previous work by Dutt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> has highlighted the opportunity of employing PEFT to tune large foundation models for medical image analysis.</p><p>We employ two different PEFT techniques: LoRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and BitFit <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. LoRA is an additive method that inserts trainable decomposition matrices in the layers of a transformer, while BitFit is a selective method that unfreezes only the bias terms of the model. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">9</ref> shows a result and efficiency comparison between the two PEFT methods with a comparison to end-to-end fine-tuning and linear-probing on the NIH Chest X-ray and CheXpert datasets using the DINOv2 ViT-g/14 model. In this section we will show qualitative results of DINOv2 features using principal component analysis (PCA) performed on DINOv2 patch features on X-ray, CT, and MRI scans, following the method delineated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. We will also provide organ segmentation results of linear compared U-Net decoders.</p><p>PCA visualization. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows the first three PCA components. The PCA is computed between patches of images that are in the same column, and the first 3 components are shown for X-ray, CT, and MRI scans. Thresholding is used on the first PCA component to remove the background. Just like in natural images <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the colors of the three PCA components correspond well with the same parts of images in the same category. This is an easier task however, compared to natural images, because there is less variability between examinations on medical images compared to natural images.</p><p>U-Net and linear decoder visualization. We also show a visualization of linear and U-Net decoders trained on top of DINOv2 ViT-L/14 features. The linear layer decoder performs surprisingly well, but is limited, especially on smaller masks, due to the smaller decoding map (32x32 pixels interpolated to 448x448) and less adjustable parameters. As expected, the U-Net segmentation results are smoother and represents the ground truth mask more accurately, but is still limited due to the frozen encoder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Foundation models have shown promise for reducing the data annotation problem and increasing model generalizability and robustness. Especially in the medical image analysis domain where data annotation is considerably more expensive than other fields, and where model robustness is critical, these foundation models hold promise towards increasing performance and adoption of deep learning systems in healthcare. The DINOv2 pre-training approach is specifically promising given its ability to learn general-purpose representations and perform well out-of-the-box in linear probing and kNN settings. We believe that using DINOv2 pre-training on medical data is a promising approach for future research aimed at building large-scale medical foundation models whiteout supervision.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Cross-task Generalizability Analysis</head><p>In this section, we evaluate whether DINOv2 can produce representations that are more generalizable across tasks, compared to other models. To accomplish this task, we plot in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> the relative performance of weakly-supervised and self-supervised methods across both disease classification and organ segmentation. The horizontal axis shows the relative performance or ranking of each of the models on segmentation tasks, while the vertical axis does the same for classification tasks. The ranking is calculated as the average ranking across all segmentation or classification tasks, where rank 1 means the model performs the best relative to the other models. An interesting observation is that models pre-trained with weakly-supervised learning perform well only on classification tasks, while MAE performs well only on segmentation. DINOv2 can generalize across both tasks and outperforms all other models for classification.</p><p>DINOv2 corss-task generalizability compared to supervised methods. Additionally, we carry out two experiments to compare the task-generalizability of DINOv2 with supervised methods. First, we compare the segmentation performance of a DINOv2 pre-trained ViT-L/14 with a ViT-L/16 pre-trained with supervised learning on ImageNet21k. Table <ref type="table">7</ref> shows the results. DI-NOv2 outperforms the supervised ViT on 4 out of the 5 organ segmentation tasks, especially in the challenging AMOS multi-organ segmentation task.</p><p>Our second experiment compares the performance of the SAM image encoder with DINOv2 on classification tasks. SAM was trained for prompt-based segmentation and does not have a CLS token. To perform classification with SAM we averaged all the patch embeddings and treated the result as a CLS token. Table <ref type="table">8</ref> shows the results. Images are of size 1024x1024 and only a subset of each dataset was used because of computational limits. DINOv2 significantly outperforms SAM on both datasets, highlighting the cross-task generalizability of the model.  </p></div>			</div>

		<title level="a" type="main">(2021) Volume 2, Issue 4 Cultural Implications of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC Authors: Dr. Unsa Jamshed Amar Jahangir Anbrin Khawaja Abstract: This study is an attempt to highlight the cultural implication of CPEC on Pak-China relations, how it will align two nations culturally, and what steps were taken by the governments of two states to bring the people closer. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China, the cultural aspect of relations between the two states also moved forward. The flow of cultural delegations intensified after the 2010, because this year was celebrated as the ‘Pak-China Friendship Year’. This dimension of relations further cemented between the two states with the signing of CPEC in April 2015. CPEC will not only bring economic prosperity in Pakistan but it will also bring two states culturally closer. The roads and other communication link under this project will become source of cultural flow between the two states.

In this perspective, political figures frequently use twitter to highlight their political as well as personal lives worldwide. However, political figures take the stardom status among the twitter audience that follow, retweet and comment by their fans. The purpose of this study is, to analyze what kind of language, level of interest is made by political figures while communicating via twitter, text, phrases and languages used by political figures, and do their tweets contribute in their reputation. The qualitative content analysis is used for evaluation of the interests shared by PM Imran Khan, PM Boris John Son and PM Narendra Modi with the key words of tweets. A well-established coding sheet is developed for the analysis of text, phrases and words in the frames of negative, positive and neutral from March 2020 to May 2020. The results are demonstrating on the basis of content shared by Prime Ministers of three countries i.e., From Pakistan, Imran Khan, United Kingdom, Johnson Boris and India, Narendra Modi on twitter. The findings also reveal that varied issues discussed in tweets, significantly positive and neutral words are selected by these political figures. PM Imran tweeted more negative tweets than PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi. However, PM Boris Johnson and PM Narendra Modi make significant positive and neutral tweets. It is observed that political figures are conscious about their personal reputation while tweeting. It also revealed that the issues and tweets shared by these leaders contribute to their personal reputation.

However, this relationship becomes more questionable when policy uncertainty is added in it. Hence, this paper presents evidence on the effect of government size on economic growth in the presence of budget uncertainty measured through three different approaches. Rather than relying on the traditional and complicated measures of uncertainty, a new method of measuring uncertainty based on government budget revisions of total spending is introduced and compared with the other competing approaches. Using time series annual data from 1973-2018, the short run and long run coefficients from Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) framework validate the negative effect of budget uncertainty and government size on economic growth of Pakistan regardless of the uncertainty measure used. Therefore, to attain the long run economic growth, along with the control on the share of government spending in total GDP, government should keep the revisions in the budget as close to the initial announcements as it can so that uncertainty can be reduced. Further, the uncertainty in fiscal spending calculated through the deviation method raises a big question on the credibility of fiscal policy in Pakistan. Higher will be the deviation higher will be the uncertainty and lower the fiscal policy credibility hence making fiscal policy less effective in the long run.

The paper argues that The Alchemist is a cynical and despairing play created in an atmosphere not suitable for a comedy. This is a qualitative study of the text and aims at an analysis of the theme, situations, characters, language, and the mood of the play to determine that Jonson is unable to retain the comic spirit in The Alchemist and in an attempt to “better men” (Prologue. 12) he becomes more satirical and less humorous or comic. This research is important for it contends that the play, termed as a comedy, may be read as a bitter satire on the cynical, stinky, and despairing world of the Elizabethan times.

With the application of containment Policy, the U.S. achieved much success in international politics. Over time China has become more powerful and sees great power in international politics. China wants to expand and launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The primary purpose of The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is to achieve support from regional countries and save their interests from the U.S. In 2017, the American administration launched its Containment policy through Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad) to keep their interest from China. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) is comprising of Australia, the United States, Japan, and India. This Study is based on Qualitative research with theoretical application of Game theory. This research investigates both plans of China (BRI) and the U.S. (the Quad) through a Game Theory. In this study, China and the U.S. both like to act as gamers in international politics. This study recommends that Game theory can predict all developments in the long term.

The Prince is the book of Niccolo Machiavelli a great philosopher of his time. If Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi qualifies as a Prince of Machiavelli is a very important question. This is answered in the light of his policies and strategies to become the undisputed political leader of India. Much of the Machiavellian Prince deals with the problem of how a layman can raise himself from abject and obscure origins to such a position that Narendra Modi has been holding in India since 2014. The basic theme of this article is revolving around the question that is following: Can Modi’s success be attributed to techniques of The Prince in important respects? This article analyzed Narendra Modi's policies and strategies to develop an analogy between Machiavellian Prince and Modi in terms of characteristics and political strategies. This research work examines, how Narendra Modi became the strongest person in India.

This Lyotardian paradigm extends a subversive challenge to all the grand narratives that have been enjoying the status of an enviable complete code of life in the world for a long time. Even a cursory scan over the play under analysis creates a strong feel that Beckett very smartly, comprehensively and successfully questioned the relevance of the totalizing metanarratives to the present times. Being an imaginative writer, he was well aware of the fact that ridicule is a much more useful weapon than satire in the context of political literature. There are so many foundationalist ideologies that he ridicules in his dramatic writing. Christianity as a religion is well exposed; the gravity of philosophy is devalued; the traditional luxury that the humans get from the art of poetry is ruptured and the great ideals of struggle are punctured. He achieves his artistic and ideologically evolved authorial intentions with a ringing success. It is interesting to note that he maintains a healthy balance between art and message.

Kashmir is the unfinished agenda of partition and a stumbling block in the bilateral relations between Pakistan and India. After the partition of sub-continent in 1947, Pakistan and India got their sovereign status. Kashmir conflict, a disputed status state, is the byproduct of partition. Pakistan and India are traditional arch-foes. Any clash between Pakistan and India can bring the two nuclear states toe-to-toe and accelerate into nuclear warfare. Due to the revulsion, hostility and lack of trust between the two, the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue has been long overdue. Ever-increasing border spats, arms race and threat of terrorism between the two have augmented anxiety in the subcontinent along with the halt of talks between India and Pakistan at several times. Additionally, it hampers the economic and trade ties between the two. India, time and again, backtracked on Kashmir issue despite UN efforts to resolve the issue. Recently, Indian government has responded heavy-handedly to the Kashmiri agitators’ demand for sovereignty and revocation of ‘Special Status’ of Kashmir impacting the stability of the region in future.

Data comprises the official discourse which is used in diplomatic affairs of both the states. The extensive investigation seeks insights from the fundamentals of Critical Discourse Analysis propounded by van Dijk, Fairclough and Wodak with a special focus on Bhatia’s (2006) work. The study reveals that the image of China has always been accorded priority within Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourse even though nature of bilateral relations among China, India and Pakistan is based on entirely different dynamics; Indian and Pakistani diplomatic discourses are reflective of sensitivities involved within the bilateral relations. Through employment of linguistic techniques of ‘positivity’, ‘evasion’ and ‘influence and power’, Indian diplomats have managed not to compromise over the fundamentals in bilateral relations with China despite Pakistan’s already strengthened and deep-rooted relations with China. While Pakistani diplomatic fronts have been equally successful in further deepening their already strengthened relations in the midst of surging controversies on CPEC, BRI and OBOR. Hence, diplomatic fronts of both the counties, through employment of ideologically loaded linguistic choices, leave no stone unturned in consolidation of the diplomatic relations with China.

All the students from two years master (M.A) degree programme and four years (BS) degree programme of eight departments from International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI), Faculty of Social Sciences were taken as a population of the study. 475 students were randomly selected as a sample of the study. The Academic Advising Inventory (AAI) was used to assess Academic Advising Style. For measuring level of the satisfaction, descriptive statistics was used. To compare the mean difference department-wise and gender-wise about academic advising satisfaction t.test was applied. It was concluded that from the major findings of the study those students who received departmental academic advising style are more satisfied as compared to those students who provided prescriptive academic advising style. Female students seemed more satisfied as compared to male students regarding the academic advising style provided to them. Students who satisfied from developmental academic advising style and they were also highly satisfied from the advising provided to them at Personalizing Education (PE) and this is the subscale of developmental academic advising whereas students who received prescriptive academic advising they were also satisfied from the advising provided to them regarding personalizing education and academic decision making but their percentage is less. It is recommended to Universities Administration to focus on Developmental Academic Advising Style and establish centers at universities/department level and nominate staff who may be responsible to provide developmental academic advising.

The shift in average temperature is putting negative impacts on human health, food production and the natural resources. In the wake of the altered climate, water flow in the river systems is experiencing variability and uncertainty. This paper aims at studying the negative impacts of climate change on the water resources of the Indus Basin and investigate the prospects of cooperation between India and Pakistan; two major riparian nations sharing the basin. Adopting the case study approach, a theoretical framework has been built on the ‘Theory of the International Regimes’.

This needs a valid and reliable measure to assess the differentiation of self particularly in a relationship with parents. Behavior\Emotional Reactivity Index is such a tool that fulfills this purpose. The present study was carried out to culturaly adapt and translate BERI into the Urdu language and establish the psychometric properties of Urdu version. A sample of 303 adolescents of age (M = 16.07, SD = 1.77) was taken from different schools and colleges. Scale was split into Mother and father forms for the convenience of respondents. Findings supported the original factor structure of the BERI-original version. Higher-order factor analysis showed good fit indices with excellent alpha ranges (α= .91 to α=.80). BERI scores were compared for the adolescents who were securely attached with parents and insecurely attached with parents which showed a significant difference between the groups. BERI-Urdu version was found to be a valid and reliable measure in the Pakistani cultural context which gives researchers new directions to work with adolescents.

Is it possible for an individual to adjust in a society where he/she loses his/her individuality and becomes part of collectivity? One point of view is that for society to flourish, man needs to be repressed. But to what extent is repression necessary for societies to rise and survive? This paper shall examine the above given questions from the standpoint of two thinkers who greatly influenced twentieth-century thought: Sigmund Freud and Herbert Marcuse. To undertake this task, first the term Repression shall be examined and then the notions of Freud and Marcuse will be discussed to determine the degree of repression required for the development of modern society.

The boundaries of geographies play a significant role in shaping fates, biographies, social superstructures and shared collective histories of its residents. Considering this, Henri Lefebvre and Edward William Soja, argue that space is something which determines the living circumstances within the particular social framework and instigates and controls various societal happenings. City space of Karachi suffers from appalling distortions as a part of postmodern, globalized and capitalist world. By employing Lefebvre’s idea of spatial triad and Soja’s views of the trialectrics of spaciality, this paper foregrounds how social space enforces spatial injustice and serves for the inculcation of spatial cleansing in the lives of inhabitants of urban space. Using Shamsie’s Kartography as an interpretive tool for contemporary urban environment, this paper inquires the engrafting of spatial cleansing in the lives of Karachiites resulting in multiple standardization and segregation on the basis of living standards among different social strata. This research substantiates how in Kartography, Materialism nibbles the roots of social values and norms while sequentially administering Spatial Injustice in the lives of Karachiites. This paper proclaims the scarcity of execution of Spatial Justice in the lives of common people in this postmodern globalized capitalist era. This paper urges the possibility of a utopian urban space with enforced spatial justice where people can be saved from dilemmas of injustice and segregation, especially Karachiites.

The entire Middle East region is fraught with tensions, conflicts, civil wars and rivalries. From strategic interests to power grabbing, sectarian divisions, flaws in the civil and social structure of the state and society, ethnic insurrections, and many other shapes of instability syndromes can be diagnosed in this region. In the post-Arab Spring, 2011, the emerging new regional hierarchical order for power/dominance, in addition to the weakening/declining dominant US power in the region, changed the entire shape of already conflict-ridden region. New weak or collapsing states and bifurcation of the ‘status quo’ and ‘counter-hegemonic’ states along with their respective allies, made this region a prototype of instability in the regional security complex of the Middle East, as a direct result of these developments. The perpetuation of these abnormalities would not recede this instability conundrum from the region, provoking third party intervention, if not contained.

The study concludes that the unaccusative verbs only project an internal argument. It does not require the event argument. However, the said verb can be causativised by adding external argument and at the same time the event argument gets included in the valency of the derived causative of the unaccusative root. The unergative, on the other hand, requires an external argument as an obligatory argument while the internal argument is not the obligatory argument of the verb. The event argument is also a part of the valency of the verb. The APFs require one argument which is the internal argument of the verb. However, since the external argument is not available, the internal argument of the verb gets realized as the subject of the verb. The verb does not project event argument. The ergative predicates are derived by the suppression of the external argument and by the externalization of the internal argument.

Its geo-strategic location affects its national identity as a nation state. Unlike Europe in South Asia security dilemma, proxy warfare and nuclear arms race are consistent features of the regional politics. The identity of Pakistan as security-centric state gives its army disproportional power, which created institutional imbalance that directly affected constitutionalism in the country. The constitution of Pakistan is based on principles of civilian supremacy and separation of power but in reality Pakistan’s army is the most powerful institution in country. This paper argues that the structure of Pakistani politics; created institutional imbalances by the disproportionate distribution of resources is the key variable in creating dichotomy.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical framework. A total of 250 young consumers in the two cities of Southern Punjab, Pakistan was randomly sampled and data were collected via a face-to-face survey method. Partial least square technique was employed to test the model. The results showed that attitude towards organic food purchasing motivated when moral norms were activated to consume organic food products. Further, environmental knowledge moderated the relationship of organic food purchase intentions and behaviour significantly. The findings highlighted the importance of moral norms as a meaningful antecedent that could increase the TP-based psychosocial processes if consumers have sufficient environmental knowledge. Therefore, farmers, organic products marketers, government administrators, and food retailers should take initiatives not only to highlight the norms and values but also when promoting organic food production and consumption.

The study under research examines the perspectives of two similar groups of the final year students of at Higher Education Institutions of Pakistan. The first group consists of art students who received the Urdu medium of instruction (UMI), and the second group received the English medium of instruction (EMI). An empirical methodology was carried out in the present year, students answered questionnaires to find out the benefits and challenges of learning subject-based knowledge, what subject-based knowledge means to them, and their understanding of language as a teaching language. Interviews were conducted with the selected group of students who wished to participate in research. Additional information is available from the tests and results obtained in the two equivalent courses. Although many similarities have been identified between the two groups, the overall knowledge of disciplinary knowledge of English medium instruction students was not very effective, while that of UMI students was very effective.

Ecofeminism critiques masculine dominance highlighting its role in creating and perpetuating gender discrimination, social inequity and environmental degradation. Women suffer more because of power disparity in society. Environmental crises affect women more than men because of their already precarious existence and subaltern position. There is affinity between women and nature are victims of climate change and other environmental hazards. Cheryl Glotfelty introduced interdisciplinary approach to the study of literature and environment. Literary ecology as an emerging discipline explores the intriguing relationship between environment and literature. Ecofeminism draws on feminist critique of gender inequality showing how gender categories inscribed in power structure exploit both women and nature. Francoise d‘Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminism to critique the prevalent exploitation of both women and environment. Ecofeminism asserts that exploitation of women and degradation of the environment are the direct result of male dominance and capitalism. Ecofeminism argues for redressing the plight of women and protection of environment. Vonnegut’s play ‘Happy Birthday Wanda June’ was written at a time when the movement for the right of women and protection of environment were gaining momentum. The play shows how toxic masculinity rooted in power and capitalism exploit both women and environment.

Understanding qawwali context requires comprehension of semantics or process of meaning creation and meaning sharing among the qawwal party and the audience. This interactive activity might frequently be hindered when interrupted by subjective meanings creation during cultural consumption. Qawwali is a cultural tradition, its semantics are conditioned by axiological premises of poetry and perceptions which are transforming. The previous researches revealed that qawwali is associated with religion which provides the religious message by singing hamd and naat. It was a means to experience Divine; therefore, semantics are multi-layered and often crossroad with values and subjective experiences. It is novel due to its ritual of Sama. It has the therapeutic power that helps mentally disturbed people and they find refuge. This study is exploratory having a small sample size of twenty purposively selected audiences. This phenomenological inquiry used ethnographic method of conversational interviews at selected shrines and cultural spaces in Islamabad. The results indicate that qawwali is a strong refuge for people facing miseries of life and they attend Sama with a belief that attending and listening will consequently resolve their issues, either psychological or physiological. They participate in Sama which teaches them how to be optimistic in a negative situation; this paper brings forth this nodal phenomenon using the verbatim explanations by the interlocutors. Semantics of Qawwali are conditioned and some of these elements are highlighted including poetry and axiology based perceptions and cultural consumption of a cultural realm.

The natives are majorly involved in illegal transportation of goods and objects, therefore; the study sets to explain how significant smuggling for the local people is. It describes the kinship role in reciprocity of their trade and transportation. The qualitative methods such as purposive sampling and interview guide were employed for data collection. The research findings revealed that local people were satisfied with their illegal trading which is depended largely on their expertise and know-how of smuggling at borders. They disclosed that their total economy was predominantly based on smuggling of stuff like drugs, diesel, oil, gas, petrol, ration food from Iran, and human trafficking. They also enjoyed the privilege of possessing Sajjil (Iranian identity card), thus; the dual nationality helped them in their daily business and rahdari (border crossing agreement), enabling them to travel to Iran for multiple purposes.

The Kafkaesque is characterised by the following: World is a huge forking labyrinthine institution where the man has been thrown to suffer its complexities, confrontation with the labyrinth makes his existence meaningless because freedom is a taboo in no man’s land, he is punished for an unknown sin for which he seeks justification from the superior authorities, but his efforts are viewed as ludicrous or comic despite the underlying sense of tragedy. (5) The Kafkaesque tendency to present tragic situation comically is also explored in Abe’s novel. The paper studies the effect of higher authorities exercising their power over man and the inscrutability of cosmic structures continuously undermining human freedom in nightmarish conditions. The paper establishes Kobo Abe in the literary world as a writer who portrays the hollowness and futility of human lives with a Kafkaesque touch.

Althusser believes that ideology is a belief system of a society in which ideological agencies establish hierarchies in society through reinforcement and discrimination for cultural conditioning. These agencies function through ideological state apparatuses. These ideological agencies help to construct individual identity in society. The undesirable ideologies promote repressive political agendas. The non-repressive ideologies are inhaled by the individuals as a natural way of looking at the culture and society. This research seeks to investigate Omar Shahid Hamid’s novel The Spinners Tales through the lens of Althusser’s ideology and interpellation. This study examines how the characters of Shahid’s novel inhaled ideology and became its subjects. This research also depicts the alarming effects of cultural hegemony that creates cultural infidelity and hierarchies between the bourgeoisie and proletariat classes.

It controlled the Indian education field till the establishment of Indian Education Commission, 1882. The Despatch provided space to Christian missionaries by promising government’s gradual withdrawal from the education in favour of missionaries. It also facilitated the missionaries by offering system of ‘grants on aid’ to the private bodies. Consequently, the missionaries fancied to replace the government institutions in the Punjab and initiated their efforts to increase the number of their educational institutions. They tried to occupy the educational field by establishing more and more educational institutions. But after the Recommendations of the Indian Education Commission 1882, a change in their policy of numeric increase of educational institutions is quite visible. With the turn of the century, they are found to be eager to establish a few institutions with good quality of education. This paper intends to analyse different factors behind the change of their policy of quantitative dominance to qualitative improvement. It also attempts to evaluate how their change of policy worked and what steps were taken to improve the quality of their educational institutions. Following the historical method qualitative data comprising educational reports, missionaries’ autobiographies, Reports of missionaries’ conferences, and the other relevant primary and secondary sources has been collected from different repositories. The analysis of the data suggests that the attitude of the administration of the education department and the recommendations of Indian Education Commission were the major driving forces behind the change of missionaries’ educational policy in the 20th century. The missionaries, after adopting the new policy, worked on the quality of education in their institutions and became successful.

For control, there are legal ban/restrictions (Dowry and Wedding Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976; Amendment in Act, 1993) on its practice in Pakistan. Despite the legal cover, the custom has been extended. Dowry amount seems to be increasing due to changing lifestyle and trends of society.

A qualitative study was conducted. Data was collected by using unstructured interviews from males and females including social activists, economists, and married couples about wedding expenses, demands, society pressure, men’s support, and perception against dowry especially with regards to women’s rights and autonomy. The study concluded heavy dowry especially in terms of furniture, electronics, kitchenware, car, furnished houses, and cash highly associated with women’s development and their rights.

Lack of capacity and poor standards of governance caused nontraditional security challenges to Pakistan too. The NCOC is the central nerve center to guide the national response to COVID-19 by Pakistan and can be best analyzed in the light of the decision-making theory of Naturalist Decision Making (NDM). The study points out the effective role performed by NCOC at policy formation through a more prosaic combination of science, data, decision making and execution of decisions at the level of federalism. The study highlights the changing patterns of government’s approach during the pandemic at various levels. Pakistan faced economic, political and social crisis during this phase. This study uses a survey and key informant interviews as the source of analysis for qualitative data collection. By applying the decision- making theory, the paper extends that there is a need to use a model to balance the existing gap within the system, to meet challenges. The study suggests a coordinating approach among various units and center; that might raise the level of performance to meet the nontraditional security challenges with innovation, creativity and boldness.

Judicial review is a remedy provided by the public law and is exercised by the superior and higher courts to supervise administrative authorities' powers and functions. The main objective of the judicial review is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of individuals by public authorities. The ground of the judicial review, i.e., Unreasonableness or irrationality or popularly known as Wednesbury Unreasonableness was introduced by lord Greene in the Wednesbury Corporation case in 1948. Initially, the scope of this ground of judicial review was very narrow and was allowed only in rare cases. However, with the development of administrative law and Human rights, it also developed. Its development resulted in different controversies and issues about the application of this ground. The main issue is about its encroachment in the jurisdiction of other branches of the government i.e., the parliament and executive. The free and loose application of this principle results in confusion and conflict between different organs of the government. The present paper is based on the implications of the limitations on the ground of Wednesbury Unreasonableness both on the judicial and administrative bodies in Pakistan to avoid the chaos and confusion that results in the criticisms on this ground of judicial review.
