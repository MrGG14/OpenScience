<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cloud computing is a computing model which provides the computing services over the internet on pay-as-you-go basis. You can take the services on rent instead of building your own ITwhich results in cost saving. In this paper, we have discussed the differences between traditional IT infrastructure and cloud computing. We have also discussed the benefits of cloud, risks associated with cloud computing and the cloud models.</p></div>

We buy more servers so that at peak time they can meet our demands but at other times our servers will be idle. Suppose if we talk about online shopping site, we know that during festival days there will be more users of the site. So our site should be able to handle that load also. In cloud computing, our application may scale up or down elastically. There is no need to do capacity planning in advance. We can rent more servers based upon usage.</p></div>

We don't know at which location server.</p><p>There are security benefits of cloud also. In cloud, multiple copies of data is placed at many places. In the case of failure, data can be easily recovered. Iaas: -In infrastructure as a service, we can take infrastructure like servers, storage, databases on rent from cloud service providers. Virtualization is the process through which we can access remote servers. AWS provide Amazon EC2 to use infrastructure as a service. In Iaas you can use the remote servers without worrying about the hardware maintenance.</p><p>Paas: -In platform as a service, we can take the platform on rent from service providers. Suppose if a student writes a first java program and he has not installed JVM on his machine. He can directly copy the java code and run the code online by using online java compiler. Paas is used by developers to develop, test and deploy software applications.</p><p>Saas:-In software as a service, we can use the software online without purchasing the license of software and installing it on computer. In saas, software upgrades and security patching is managed by the service providers. In saas, users do not have their own software. They are using the company software. Gmail is the example of saas where Gmail is the software and Google is the service provider.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. CONCLUSION</head><p>In this paper, we have discussed the concept of cloud computing which has gained lot of popularity now a days. Organizations are moving their data to cloud due to its various benefits over traditional IT infrastructure. But there is security issues related to cloud also. So there is a need to focus on the security problems to maintain the trust level of the organization</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="1,430.20,772.55,43.72,10.52;1,521.46,772.55,53.48,10.52;1,300.36,85.95,255.62,13.46;1,447.84,13.86,67.37,16.15;1,435.00,35.70,60.67,16.15;1,243.24,58.95,226.15,14.32;1,85.68,125.03,440.32,15.77;1,286.56,171.83,242.58,10.52"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>An Insight into Cloud Computing Paradigm and ServicesDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering</figDesc></figure>

Suppose you want to open an E-commerce company and you have to manage sales, marketing department and IT infrastructure but you have limited amount of money. In this case you want someone to manage your infrastructure so that you may focus on other departments. It is possible through cloud computing.</figDesc></figure>
