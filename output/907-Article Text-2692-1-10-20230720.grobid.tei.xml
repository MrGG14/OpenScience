<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a phrase that inferred the use of a computer to model intelligent behavior with minimal human intervention. Artificial Intelligence in medicine consist of two main branches, virtual and physical. The virtual branch involves informatics approaches, including electronic health records and active guidance of physicians in their treatment decisions. Robots that used to assist the elderly patient or the attending surgeon is the example of physical branch artificial intelligence in medicine. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,237.89,554.54,3.24,5.89">1</ref> Artificial Intelligence can replace human tasks and activities. Artificial Intelligence can complete specific tasks and overcome some of the computationally intensive and intellectual limitations of humans. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,80.54,607.70,3.24,5.89">2</ref> Recently, artificial intelligence make a big impact in healthcare. Artificial Intelligence can definitely help physicians to make better clinical decisions or even replace human judgement in certain functional areas of healthcare (eg, radiology). Applications of artificial intelligence increase the availability of healthcare data and give rapid developement of big data analytic methods. It shows the successfull applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare. Artificial intelligence techniques can solve clinically relevant information hidden in the massive amount of data led by relevant questions and help clinical decision making. <ref type="bibr" coords="1,68.54,767.21,3.24,5.89">3</ref> categories and stratifying the severity of ailments and health for non-operative patients. Artificial intelligence tools can replace traditional vital signs and laboratory values, then continuously monitoring and updating that components to give signal alarms for an acutely decompensating patient. Artificial intelligence may help overcome challenges with multiple outcome optimization limitations or sequential decision-making protocols that limit individualized patient care. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,55.32,177.33,3.24,5.89">6</ref> Artificial intelligence in biomedicine have a big role in the diagnostics of diseases. Artificial intelligence allows health professionals to give earlier and more accurate diagnostics for many kinds of diseases. One major class of diagnosis is based on in vitro diagnostics using biosensors or biochips. Integrated Artificial intelligence can diagnose cardiovascular diseases in the early stage with biosensors and related pointof-care testing (POCT) systems. Artificial intelligence can help to predict the survival rates of cancer patients. Artificial intelligence also have role on medical imaging (twodimensional) and signal (one-dimensional) processing for disease diagnostic. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,111.02,336.96,3.24,5.89">7</ref> Artificial intelligence in healthcare influence patient outcomes. Artificial intelligence for drug discovery, artificial intelligence for clinical trials and patient care are some applications of medical artificial intelligence applications utilized in the healthcare industry. Clinical intelligence also analyzes patient's medical data and delivers insights to help them increase their quality of life. Maternal care, healthcare robotics, genetics artificial intelligence data-drive, artificial intelligence-powered stethoscope are significant clinical intelligence systems that improve patient care. 8 Application of artificial intelligence and the analytics of big data in healthcare are considered as one of the important achievements for the intelligent healthcare system. Big data in the healthcare contains the medical images, clinical data of doctor, doctors' prescriptions and notes, computed tomography (CT) images, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, laboratory data, documents from the drugstore, files from the insurance electronic patient record data, and other data related to the administrative operations. Big data analytics is the process of scrutinizing huge volume of data from various kinds of sources of data. Various analytical methods such as data mining and artificial intelligence can be put in to examine the data. Approaches for big data analytics can be used to identify the abnormalities obtained as a result of combining large volume of data from different sources of data. 9 Artificial intelligence is need to identify the risk of noncommunicable disease, such as heart disease and diabetes. A non-communicable disease risk prediction closed-loop system can predict the risk of developing life-threatening disease (e.g. diabetes, thyroid, and stroke) at early stage then the public health of any community can be improved significantly, which can extend the life span of individuals as well. Recently, there has been growing interest to incorporate machine learning into cyber-physical systems, which can facilitate the disease classification, detection, monitoring, and prediction of several non-communicable diseases. The multistage conversion of heterogeneous internet of things sensor data into a meaningful dataset opens new door to predict the risk of non-communicable diseases from the lowlevel sensor data in human-cyber-physical systems. This has enabled the machine learning classification algorithms random forest and random tree to perform with 94% accuracy or more. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,349.63,203.97,6.48,5.89">10</ref> In healthcare, traditional machine can predicting what treatment protocols are likely to succeed on a patient based on various patient attributes and the treatment context. 11 There is a very large amount of unstructured textual data consist of doctors' notes, test results, lab reports, medication orders, and discharge instructions in healthcare. Artificial intelligence can extract critical information about patients from such rich descriptive data, helping improve diagnoses and treatment recommendations. The capacity for machines to digest huge amounts of imagery and textual data quickly through machine learning and natural language processing will enable physicians to make timely diagnoses and treatment decisions, which can give advantage on health service delivery. 12 RISK AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENSES Health care industry adopts artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other modeling techniques that give benefits to both patient outcomes and cost reduction. However, we have to aware and ensure the risk and the unintended consequenses. Other industries provide a framework for acknowledging and managing data, machine, and human biases to manage the risk while implementing artificial intelligence. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,364.87,523.10,6.48,5.89">13</ref> Application of machine learning (ML) as the part of artificial intelligence developement is a great area of research. Rapid pace of change, diversity of different techniques and multiplicity of tuning parameters make it difficult to get a clear picture of how accurate these systems might be in clinical practice or how reproducible they are in different clinical contexts. Lack of consensus about how machine learning studies should report potential bias make the condition worse. Researchers need to consider how machine learning models, like scientific data sets, can be licensed and distributed to facilitate reproduction of research results in different settings. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,385.51,682.61,6.48,5.89">14</ref> The lack of interpretability in artificial intelligence models is an obstacle to their widespread adoption in the healthcare domain. The absence of understandability and transparency frequently cause inadequate accountability and a consequent reduction in the quality of the predictive results of the models. On the other hand, the existence of interpretability in the predictions of artificial intelligence models will facilitate the understanding and trust of the clinicians in these complex models. The data protection regulations worldwide emphasize the relevance of the plausibility and verifiability of artificial intelligence models' predictions. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,213.29,110.85,6.48,5.89">15</ref> Many private entities own and controll artificial intelligence technologies. The nature of the implementation of artificial intelligence could mean such corporations, clinics and public bodies will have a greater than typical role in obtaining, utilizing and protecting patient health information. This raises privacy issues relating to implementation and data security. The first set of concerns includes access, use and control of patient data in private hands. Some recent public-private partnerships that implementing artificial intelligence have poor protection of privacy. Appropriate safeguards must be conducted to maintain privacy and patient agency. Another set of concerns is the external risk of privacy breaches through artificial intelligence-driven methods. Regulation should confirm patient agency and consent, and should encourage increasingly sophisticated methods of data anonymization and protection. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,158.06,323.64,6.48,5.89">16</ref> Job displacement from automation and management of human-machine interactions is the anticipated implication of the use of artificial intelligence applications. 17 Artificial intelligence applications must be implemented with care regarding potential loss of jobs or professional reputation, highlighting the potential of artificial intelligence to remove the tedious aspects of work, improve job satisfaction and provide new skills. This must be coupled with careful attention to clinicians' training needs and career development. 18</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINE LEARNING AND AI IN HEALTHCARE</head><p>The history of artificial intelligence started in 1950 when Alan Turing and his proposed machine that can learn and capable of becoming artificial intelligence are brought into public eyes. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,86.66,549.62,6.48,5.89">19</ref> Since then, artificial intelligence has been developed and applied in many aspects of life including healthcare. There are two distinct major categories of artificial intelligence devices that we used. First category being machine learning techniques with capabilities to analyze structured data. In relation to healthcare use, machine learning can be used to classify patients condition and draw a probable outcomes of the patients condition. Machine learning was applied in processing radiology data, genetic research, and epidemiological studies. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,197.45,669.29,3.24,5.89">3</ref> Second category being natural language processing which extract information from unstructured data. Natural language processing produres capable of processing random data and texts to machine-readable structured data. After which, the data can be processed by machine learning techniques. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,219.41,735.77,6.48,5.89">20</ref> Machine learning techniques comprised of two categories: unsupervised learning, which capable of feature extraction, and supervised learning which is used to predict relationship between patient condition (input) and patient prognosis or diagnosis (output). <ref type="bibr" coords="3,392.59,84.33,3.24,5.89">3</ref> Artificial intelligence developments in healthcare generally used supervised learning method which provide more relevant clinical results. Some analytical techniques that were used in conjunction to supervised learning machine learning were support vector machine, neural networks, and the most recent and advanced technique, deep learning. Deep learning is superior to other machine learning techniques because it can overcome one of machine learning biggest weakness in analyzing data with high number of traits, which is very relevant in clinical settings. To give some example, one of deep learning's sub-technique, convolutional neural network was tested in clinical settings and reported over 90% diagnose accuracy in congenital cataract disease by analyzing ocular images. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,424.51,270.45,6.48,5.89">21</ref> Study also reported use of convolutional neural network with over 90% accuracy in identifying and differentiating benign and malignant skin cancer from images. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,413.83,310.32,6.48,5.89">22</ref> These results showed that convolutional neural network were comparable to experience physicians in accuracy to diagnose diseases in clinical settings. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,348.79,350.28,3.24,5.89">3</ref> Natural Language Processing is no less important compared to machine learning techniques. Natural language processing function pivoting role to extract unstructured clinical data with wide variety of traits into a useful variables that machine learning techniques can analyze to infer the likely outcome of certain patient or condition. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,431.59,429.96,6.48,5.89">23</ref> Core components of natural language processing processes are text processing and classification. Keywords that significant in relation to certain diseases are selected and then processed with machine learning techniques. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,398.23,483.14,6.48,5.89">24</ref> Studies reported that use of natural language processing in clinical settings regarding laboratorybased adverse effects can be automated thanks to natural language processing algorithm. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,461.26,523.10,6.60,5.89">25</ref> Natural language processing also reported to have successfully identified 14 variables relating to brain aneurysm after it was given with clinical notes of patients with brain aneurysm. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,504.70,562.94,6.48,5.89">26</ref> This shows that natural language processing can be used in determining complex disease and variables related to it.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE NEED FOR ETHICAL GUIDELINES AND REGULATION</head><p>Ethical guidelines and regulations regarding artificial intellegence in healthcare play a crucial role in ensuring the responsible and safe use of these technologies. In the past five years, private companies, research institutions and public sector organizations have issued principles and guidelines for ethical artificial intelligence. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,434.47,496.46,6.60,5.89">42</ref> These guidelines provide a framework for addressing various ethical considerations and potential risks associated with artificial intellegence implementation. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,380.95,536.42,6.48,5.89">43</ref> According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,406.75,549.62,6.48,5.89">44</ref> , ethical guidelines and regulations should focus on principles like beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and respect for autonomy when integrating artificial intellegence into healthcare. These guidelines aim to uphold patient rights, minimize biases, promote accountability, and maintain the trustworthiness of artificial intellegence systems. According to a study by Mittelstadt et al. <ref type="bibr" coords="4,522.10,629.42,6.48,5.89">45</ref> , robust ethical guidelines and regulations are essential to ensure the responsible and beneficial deployment of artificial intellegence in healthcare, fostering a balance between innovation and safeguarding human well-being. Also, artificial intellegence technologies can be used ethically, responsibly, and in the best interest of patients and society at large. Addressing issues such as transparency, accountability, fairness, privacy, consent, and human oversight is crucial in the context of artificial intellegence 's healthcare applications. These aspects are essential for ensuring the ethical and  <ref type="bibr" coords="5,254.21,164.13,6.48,5.89">47</ref> One of the key accountability issues in artificial intellegence healthcare is the allocation of responsibility. As artificial intellegence systems become more integrated into healthcare processes, it becomes crucial to determine who is accountable for the decisions made by these systems. Healthcare providers, developers, regulatory bodies, and even artificial intellegence algorithms themselves may all have different levels of responsibility depending on their roles and contributions to the artificial intellegence technology. Fairness focuses on preventing biases and discrimination in artificial intellegence algorithms, ensuring equitable access to healthcare services for all individuals. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,192.53,323.64,6.48,5.89">48</ref> Privacy safeguards personal health information and ensures that artificial intellegence systems handle data securely and confidentially. Consent ensures that individuals have the right to make informed decisions about their involvement in artificial intellegence-driven healthcare interventions. Lastly, human oversight is critical to ensure that artificial intellegence is used as a tool to augment human decision-making rather than replacing human judgment altogether. Clinicians play a vital role in shaping guidelines and ensuring the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) for the benefit of patients and the delivery of equitable, high-quality care. As the frontline providers of healthcare, clinicians bring invaluable expertise and insights into the development, implementation, and evaluation of artificial intellegence systems in clinical settings. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,144.02,523.10,6.48,5.89">49</ref> Their active involvement during the guideline development process helps formulate guidelines that are practical, effective, and aligned with ethical principles. Additionally, clinicians contribute to the responsible implementation of artificial intellegence technologies by assessing feasibility, providing feedback on user-friendliness, and optimizing artificial intellegence algorithms to enhance safety and effectiveness. As gatekeepers of patient-centered care, clinicians critically evaluate artificial intellegence outputs, exercise clinical judgment, and advocate for equitable access and ethical use of artificial intellegence in healthcare. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,191.21,669.29,6.48,5.89">50</ref> Their expertise and dedication are instrumental in ensuring that artificial intellegence technologies are integrated ethically, responsibly, and effectively into clinical practice, ultimately improving healthcare outcomes for patients.</p></div>

In the development phase, clinicians provide valuable insights into the specific clinical needs, workflows, and challenges faced in their respective specialties. Their expertise helps in identifying areas where artificial intellegence can be most beneficial and guiding the design of artificial intellegence algorithms and systems that align with clinical requirements. Clinicians can collaborate with artificial intellegence developers, providing feedback, testing prototypes, and ensuring that the technology is intuitive, user-friendly, and aligned with clinical practices. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,552.82,190.65,6.60,5.89">51</ref> During the implementation stage, clinicians actively participate in integrating artificial intellegence into their daily workflow and patient care processes. They work closely with technology teams to ensure seamless integration, evaluate the impact on workflow efficiency, and provide feedback on usability and practicality. Clinicians can also assist in training their peers on how to effectively use artificial intellegence systems and address any concerns or resistance that may arise during the implementation process. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,479.98,310.32,6.48,5.89">52</ref> Clinicians are instrumental in evaluating the effectiveness and safety of artificial intellegence systems. They can contribute to the monitoring and validation of artificial intellegence algorithms, assessing their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and performance in real-world clinical settings. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,508.90,376.80,6.48,5.89">53</ref> Clinicians also play a vital role in assessing the clinical outcomes and patient experiences associated with artificial intellegence implementation, helping to determine whether the technology achieves its intended goals and benefits patients. Continuous education and training programs should be established to enhance clinicians' artificial intellegence literacy, enabling them to critically assess artificial intellegence algorithms, challenge biases, and identify potential pitfalls. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,506.38,483.14,6.48,5.89">54</ref> By staying updated on artificial intellegence advancements and ethical considerations, clinicians can effectively navigate the complexities of artificial intellegence-driven healthcare and contribute to responsible and informed decision-making. Clinicians' engagement in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies will foster trust, promote responsible artificial intellegence use, and safeguard against undue reliance on technology. By actively participating in the design and evaluation of artificial intellegence systems, clinicians contribute their clinical expertise and contextual knowledge, ensuring that artificial intellegence is aligned with patient needs and the complexities of healthcare settings. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,456.94,656.09,6.48,5.89">55</ref> Clinicians' engagement helps establish transparency, explainability, and accountability in artificial intellegence systems, addressing concerns about the "black box" nature of algorithms. This active involvement also promotes a human-centered approach to artificial intellegence, where technology complements and augments the clinical decision-making process rather than replacing it. <ref type="bibr" coords="5,441.58,749.09,6.48,5.89">56</ref> By being actively engaged, clinicians can ensure that the benefits and limitations of artificial intellegence are appropriately communicated to</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0" coords="5,35.88,38.64,523.68,767.36"><head>Ethics and Regulation for Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Empowering Clinicians to Ensure Equitable and High- Quality Care 1354 Volume 03 Issue 07 July 2023 Corresponding Author: Danastri Cantya Nirmala</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc><table coords="5,36.12,72.18,243.53,102.19"><row><cell cols="5">responsible use of artificial intelligence in healthcare</cell></row><row><cell cols="5">systems.
