The cloud computing paradigm delivers computing services over the Internet, providing flexible resources, faster innovation, and economies of scale <ref type="bibr" coords="1,265.54,653.31,10.70,9.07">[1]</ref>. Cloud computing has revolutionized the way computing infrastructure is abstracted and used. It has extended to include anything that can be considered as a service <ref type="bibr" coords="1,545.07,170.29,10.70,9.07">[1]</ref>. Service providers such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft offer their own big data systems in a cost-efficient manner <ref type="bibr" coords="1,315.48,204.63,10.70,9.07">[1]</ref>. BigQuery is a Platform as a Service that supports querying using ANSI SQL and is a serverless data warehouse in GCP that enables scalable analysis over petabytes of data. Google Cloud Platform provides services for analyzing and processing big data, with built-in machine learning capabilities <ref type="bibr" coords="1,399.89,262.23,10.70,9.07">[1]</ref>. However, the required resources to manage big data in a cloud-IoT environment are still a big challenge <ref type="bibr" coords="1,356.50,285.30,10.53,9.07">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Research has shown that cloud computing can significantly improve healthcare services and contribute to continuous and systematic innovation in a big data environment. A proposed model aims to optimize virtual machine selection in cloud-IoT health services applications to manage a large amount of data in integrated Industry 4.0 <ref type="bibr" coords="1,315.48,377.24,10.70,9.07">[2]</ref>. Cloud computing is also related to big data technologies, as it can be used to handle big data sets in biology and other fields <ref type="bibr" coords="1,434.08,400.28,10.53,9.07">[4]</ref>. Adopting a Sustainable Computational Cloud technology could provide an extra boost and competitiveness, offering many benefits to people in general, businesses, and Small and Medium Enterprises <ref type="bibr" coords="1,315.48,446.36,10.71,9.07">[2]</ref>.</p><p> What are the benefits of using cloud computing for big data processing and storage? Cloud computing has become an increasingly popular solution for big data processing and storage, offering numerous benefits to businesses. One key advantage is the ability to avoid the need for costly computing hardware, dedicated space and software, as cloud computing provides hardware and software services through the Internet <ref type="bibr" coords="1,533.74,549.85,21.91,9.07">[5][2]</ref>. Cloud computing can also provide secure big data processing and storage, using tools such as Hadoop, which offers security for big data <ref type="bibr" coords="1,440.80,584.41,26.80,9.07">[5][21]</ref>. In addition to cost savings, cloud computing can enable big data to be controlled and distributed efficiently, reducing product return costs by predicting the likelihood of product returns <ref type="bibr" coords="1,315.48,630.27,22.31,9.07">[5][1]</ref>. Another significant advantage of using cloud computing for big data processing and storage is the availability of big data tools like Hadoop or Spark, which offers cost advantages for storing, processing and analyzing large amounts of data <ref type="bibr" coords="1,404.43,676.35,10.53,9.07">[1]</ref>. Moreover, cloud computing provides various capabilities for storing and processing data in third-party data centers, such as BigQuery. BigQuery can help to reduce the load on relational databases, and offers pay-as-you-go services, where charges are made based on usage. Alternatively, BigQuery also provides a flat rate service with specific slot rates and charges in daily, monthly or yearly plans. In addition to offering different options and configurations to improve query performance, BigQuery is also suitable for scenarios where data does not change often as it has built-in cache [2][1]. Overall, cloud computing can provide cost-effective solutions for big data processing and storage, enabling businesses to leverage its benefits for better decision-making and more efficient operations <ref type="bibr" coords="2,246.86,438.20,16.20,9.07">[21]</ref>.</p><p> What are the challenges of implementing cloud computing for big data? Despite the benefits of cloud computing for big data, there are still some practical challenges that need to be addressed. One major challenge is the lack of suitable tools and adequate computing resources required for implementing cloud computing for big data. This can be attributed to the fact that big data entails massive amounts of information, which makes it difficult to manage and process without the necessary resources and tools. Another critical challenge of implementing cloud computing for big data is the issue of security. Although Hadoop provides security to big data, there is still a risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. To address this challenge, symmetric key encryption algorithms such as AES are commonly used in cloud computing to ensure secure data transmission and storage. Hence, while cloud computing offers many advantages for managing big data, there are still several challenges that need to be overcome to ensure its effective implementation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. CLOUD COMPUTING ARCHITECTURE FOR BIG DATA</head><p> What are the different cloud computing architecture models used in big data processing and storage? Cloud computing systems have emerged as a crucial technology in managing big data in business intelligence models <ref type="bibr" coords="2,347.14,369.32,10.70,9.07">[6]</ref>. In particular, Cloud Computing Architecture has been proposed as a viable solution for dealing with the processing and storage challenges associated with big data <ref type="bibr" coords="2,315.48,403.64,10.70,9.07">[6]</ref>. However, there are different cloud service layers involved in big data processing and storage <ref type="bibr" coords="2,500.85,415.16,10.53,9.07">[6]</ref>. While the text does not delve into the details of various cloud computing architecture models used in big data processing and storage, it highlights Fog Computing as a new computing paradigm that extends Cloud Computing to the edge of the network. The hierarchical distributed architecture of Fog Computing is presented as a way to integrate massive numbers of infrastructure components and services in smart cities <ref type="bibr" coords="2,427.23,507.34,10.53,9.07">[7]</ref>. Despite Fog Computing's potential in this regard, CC remains the baseline technology for big data processing and storage. Therefore, it is important to understand the different cloud computing architecture models that are currently being utilized to provide effective solutions for big data processing and storage needs. Unfortunately, the text does not provide any information on the different cloud computing architecture models that are used in this context <ref type="bibr" coords="2,459.16,599.29,10.53,9.07">[2]</ref>.</p><p> How does the cloud computing architecture differ from traditional on-premise computing architecture? One of the primary differences between cloud computing architecture and traditional on-premise computing architecture is the handling of real-time data processing. Cloud computing architecture offers real-time event processing, while traditional on-premise computing architecture may not have the processing power to handle real-time data processing <ref type="bibr" coords="2,419.36,714.30,10.53,9.07">[2]</ref>. Additionally, cloud computing architecture allows for authorized external users to access real-time data directly from IoT sensors, while traditional on-premise computing architecture may require access through internal networks, making it less accessible and more limited in its reach <ref type="bibr" coords="2,419.53,771.89,10.53,9.07">[2]</ref>. In cloud-driven IoT-based big data environments, the cloud-based platform can be considered as a big data warehouse, while in traditional onpremise computing architecture, data is typically stored in traditional databases <ref type="bibr" coords="3,127.11,106.66,10.70,9.07">[2]</ref>. Moreover, in cloud computing architecture, a cloud-based platform is used to store data generated by IoT devices, while in traditional on-premise computing architecture, data is stored on physical servers located on the premises of the organization <ref type="bibr" coords="3,228.18,152.77,10.53,9.07">[2]</ref>. Another significant difference is scalability. Cloud computing architecture is highly scalable, while traditional on-premise computing architecture may require additional physical servers to accommodate increased data storage needs, which can be costly and time-consuming [2]. These differences highlight the advantages of cloud computing architecture in terms of accessibility, scalability and real-time data processing capabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head> What are the advantages and disadvantages of each cloud computing architecture model for big data?</head><p>Cloud computing offers numerous advantages and disadvantages when it comes to big data architecture. One of the primary advantages is that cloud computing provides a solution for big data through cloud services and open-source cloud software tools that make handling large amounts of data more manageable <ref type="bibr" coords="3,138.87,348.18,10.70,9.07">[6]</ref>. However, the hardware and software requirements of big data can be cost-prohibitive for small and medium-sized businesses <ref type="bibr" coords="3,185.05,371.24,10.70,9.07">[8]</ref>. There are different types of cloud computing architectures that can support big data integration, including distributed cloud, smart grid, and hybrid cloud <ref type="bibr" coords="3,94.29,405.80,10.53,9.07">[9]</ref>. A cloud-based architecture can also be used with big data to offer greater control over data distribution and management. The MetaCloudDataStorage security architecture is one example of a proposed solution to protect big data against intruders, in which data is stored in multiple cloud data centers <ref type="bibr" coords="3,179.65,463.18,15.27,9.07">[10]</ref>. Cloud computing platforms, databases, and storage solutions are also essential components of big data processing <ref type="bibr" coords="3,177.53,486.22,15.27,9.07">[11]</ref>.</p><p>As big data tools continue to advance, cloud services are increasingly being used to implement big data applications. For example, the integration of services and cloud computing architectures has been proposed as a solution to handle big data in a digital environment <ref type="bibr" coords="3,260.63,555.13,15.27,9.07">[12]</ref>. However, there are also disadvantages to using cloud computing for big data, including concerns about security and privacy. Therefore, organizations must weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each cloud computing architecture model carefully when implementing big data solutions using cloud services <ref type="bibr" coords="3,158.10,624.27,31.90,9.07">[13][14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. APPLICATIONS AND FUTURE OF CLOUD COMPUTING FOR BIG DATA</head><p> What are the common applications of cloud computing for big data?
