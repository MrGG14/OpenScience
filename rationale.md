- [x] Draw a keyword cloud based on the abstract information: Firstly we retieve the abstract from the XML file generated by Gobrid and then we draw a WordCloud based on it.

- [x] Create a visualization showing the number of figures per article: Figures are identified within the XML files generated by Gobrid. Once all figures are identified we just need to count them and represent them. We chose to represent it with a histogram.
      
- [x] Create a list of the links found in each paper: Links are searched in the XML files using regular expressions. For each paper we store all the links mentioned in it in a dictionary where the key is the paper name and the value is the list of links that appearin that paper.
